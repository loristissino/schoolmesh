.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These utilities are really only basic wrapper scripts to be used
together with SchoolMesh\. The idea is to provide flexibility\. For
instance, instead of calling directly \f[B]useradd\f[], we call
\f[B]schoolmesh_useradd\f[]\. This way, if one day we need to
change the behaviour needed to add a system user (for instance,
using \f[I]ldap\f[], or contacting a different server), we just
need to change the wrapper scripts\.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options are mostly the same as their counterpart basic posix
commands\.
