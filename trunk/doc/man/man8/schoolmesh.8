.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These utilities are really only basic wrapper scripts to be used
together with SchoolMesh.
The idea is to provide flexibility.
For instance, instead of calling directly \f[B]useradd\f[], we call
\f[B]schoolmesh_posixaccount_create\f[].
This way, if one day we need to change the behaviour needed to add
a system user (for instance, using \f[I]ldap\f[], or contacting a
different server), we just need to change the wrapper scripts.
.PP
Each utility should have its own man page (work in progress).
.SH BUGS
.PP
Probably many.
