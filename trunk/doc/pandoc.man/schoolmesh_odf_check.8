# NAME

schoolmesh\_odf\_check - Get a specific portion of an OpenOffice.org document's content.xml file

# SYNOPSIS

schoolmesh\_odf\_check *path/to/document* *row* *column*

# DESCRIPTION

When generating documents from templates, sometimes weird errors occur, and 
the generated document cannot be opened (OpenOffice.org complains saying
*Format error discovered in the file in the sub-document content.xml at ...
(row, col)*).

This utility might be handy to find the specific error.

When preparing templates, you may want to uncheck *Size optimization for 
XML format* in the General tab of the Load/Save section of OpenOffice.org 
options dialog.

# EXAMPLES

	schoolmesh_odf_check ~/Desktop/myfile.odt 2 5218
