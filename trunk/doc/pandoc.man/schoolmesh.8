# DESCRIPTION

These utilities are really only basic wrapper scripts to be used together with
SchoolMesh. The idea is to provide flexibility. For instance, instead of calling
directly __useradd__, we call __schoolmesh\_posixaccount\_create__. This way, if one day we 
need to change the behaviour needed to add a system user (for instance, using _ldap_,
or contacting a different server), we just need to change the wrapper scripts.

Each utility should have its own man page (work in progress).

# BUGS

Probably many.
