# NAME

schoolmesh - command line utilities to be used with SchoolMesh web application 

# SYNOPSIS

schoolmesh\_user\_add *params*   
schoolmesh\_user\_del *params*   
schoolmesh\_user\_changeusername *params*   
schoolmesh\_user\_quotaget *params*   
schoolmesh\_user\_quotaset *params*     
schoolmesh\_dir\_changeperms *params*

schoolmesh\_dir\_create *params*
schoolmesh\_dir\_extattrget *params*  
schoolmesh\_dir\_extattrset *params*  


# DESCRIPTION

These utilities are really only basic wrapper scripts to be used together with
SchoolMesh. The idea is to provide flexibility. For instance, instead of calling
directly __useradd__, we call __schoolmesh\_user\_adduser__. This way, if one day we 
need to change the behaviour needed to add a system user (for instance, using _ldap_,
or contacting a different server), we just need to change the wrapper scripts.

The wrappers provided are described here below.
