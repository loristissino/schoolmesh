Schools often use several applications to manage activities.

Starting from a situation observed in an Italian high school, where Intranet- and Internet-based applications (Samba, Squid-cache, Google Apps, Moodle, SchoolTool, etc.) had to be integrated to work together, we are developing a web-based application that tries to mesh the things together.

We also offer teachers' workplans and final reports management, projects management, etc.

The application is fully internationalized and localized in Italian.
