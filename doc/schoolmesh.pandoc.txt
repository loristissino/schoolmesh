# NAME

schoolmesh - command line utilities to be used with SchoolMesh web application 

# SYNOPSIS

schoolmesh\_useradd [*options*] login  
schoolmesh\_userdel [*options*] login  
schoolmesh\_usermod [*options*] login  
schoolmesh\_quotaget login  
schoolmesh\_quotaset [*options*] login  

# DESCRIPTION

These utilities are really only basic wrapper scripts to be used together with
SchoolMesh. The idea is to provide flexibility. For instance, instead of calling
directly __useradd__, we call __schoolmesh\_useradd__. This way, if one day we 
need to change the behaviour needed to add a system user (for instance, using _ldap_,
or contacting a different server), we just need to change the wrapper scripts.

# OPTIONS

Options are mostly the same as their counterpart basic posix commands.

# SEE ALSO

The SchoolMesh project is described ad <http://schoolmesh.mattiussilab.net/>.
