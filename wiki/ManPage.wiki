       application

DESCRIPTION
       These utilities are really  only  basic  wrapper  scripts  to  be  used
       together  with  SchoolMesh.  The  idea  is  to provide flexibility. For
       instance,   instead   of   calling   directly    useradd,    we    call
       schoolmesh_user_adduser.  This  way,  if  one day we need to change the
       behaviour needed to add a system user (for  instance,  using  ldap,  or
       contacting  a  different  server),  we  just need to change the wrapper
       scripts.

       The wrappers provided are described here below.
