DESCRIPTION
       These utilities are really only basic wrapper scripts to be used together with SchoolMesh. The idea is to provide flexibility. For
       instance, instead of calling directly useradd, we call schoolmesh_posixaccount_create. This way, if one day we need to change  the
       behaviour  needed  to  add  a system user (for instance, using ldap, or contacting a different server), we just need to change the
       wrapper scripts.

       Each utility should have its own man page (work in progress).

BUGS
       Probably many.
