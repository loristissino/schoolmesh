NAME
       schoolmesh  -  command  line  utilities	to be used with SchoolMesh web
       application

UTILITY LIST
       schoolmesh_application_dumptables

       schoolmesh_application_importtables

       schoolmesh_application_update

       schoolmesh_posixaccount_changefullname

       schoolmesh_posixaccount_create

DESCRIPTION
       These utilities are really  only  basic	wrapper  scripts  to  be  used
       together  with  SchoolMesh.  The  idea  is  to provide flexibility. For
       instance,   instead   of   calling   directly	useradd,    we	  call
       schoolmesh_posixaccount_create.	This way, if one day we need to change
       the behaviour needed to add a system user (for instance, using ldap, or
       contacting  a  different  server),  we  just need to change the wrapper
       scripts.

       Each utility should have its own man page (work in progress).

BUGS
       Probably many.
