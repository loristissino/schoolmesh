== Disk quotas and ACL ==

You might want to use !SchoolMesh to see and set disk quotas of your users, and to use ACLs.

The file _/etc/fstab_ could need to be edited in order to have _usrquota_ and _acl_ settings.

Example:

{{{
# /dev/sdb5
UUID=73c413d6-a6d6-4279-ad84-0255d1db83de /home ext3 relatime,defaults,usrquota,acl       0       2
}}}
