1. The symfony framework: http://www.symfony-project.org/

2. Some icons from open source collections, like Crystal Clear http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Clear (GPL) and Silk http://www.famfamfam.com/archive/silk-icon-set-released/ (CC Attribution 3.0)

=Registered Trademarks=

Some trademarks used in the application and in the documentation are registered.

We will list them here, trying to mention them all:
