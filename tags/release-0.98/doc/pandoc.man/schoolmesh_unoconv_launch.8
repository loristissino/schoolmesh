# NAME

schoolmesh\_unoconv\_launch - launch Unoconv and locks the screen at once

# SYNOPSIS

schoolmesh\_unoconv\_launch 

# DESCRIPTION

This script should be used by an unprivileged user just in order to have a 
working instance of Unoconv converter running and listening to client 
unoconv calls.

The user might have an automatic login, and therefore the script locks the 
screen immediately after.

WARNINGS

This assumes that the user uses GNOME. For other desktop environments, the 
command to lock the screen must be found.

# BUGS

Probably many.

# SEE ALSO
