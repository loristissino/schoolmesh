# SchoolTool #

The basic idea of SchoolMesh is to use existing resources, if possible.

One interesting resource available for schools is [SchoolTool](http://www.schooltool.org/), "the global student information system".

It would be nice to integrate some functionalities of SchoolTool in SchoolMesh, just not to reinvent the wheel.

At the moment, unfortunately, there is no integration at all.
