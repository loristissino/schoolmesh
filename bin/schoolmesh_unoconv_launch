#@ # NAME
#@
#@ {} - launch Unoconv and locks the screen at once
#@
#@ # SYNOPSIS
#@
#@ {} 
#@
#@ # DESCRIPTION
#@
#@ This script should be used by an unprivileged user just in order to have a working
#@ instance of Unoconv converter running and listening to client unoconv calls.
#@ 
#@ The user might have an automatic login, and therefore the script locks the screen
#@ immediately after.
#@ 
#@ WARNINGS
#@ 
#@ This assumes that the user uses GNOME. For other desktop environments, the command
#@ to lock the screen must be found.
